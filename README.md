### For the final Project, we have chosen the Virus Spread Simulation 

Our team is called "Pomerebucen" and it consists of three people:
  1. Safaralibek Murodov  
  2. Sherkhon Khudododkhonov
  3. Murodsulton Amunbekova

### Project Description: 

For the final project, our team decided to do the Virus Spread Simulation. The provided template code sets the framework for the project that was developed by us. 
The project itself is about the spread of a virus in a city of 1,048,576 (=1024 * 1024) people over ten years. Each person in the city can be in four different stages:

  1. pre-virus stage - not infected but not immune.
  2. infectious stage - infected and contagious, but not yet showing symptoms.
  3. recovery stage -  infected and showing symptoms, assumed to be quarantined and no longer infectious; a simulated person may be hospitalized and die during this stage.
  4. immune stage - recovered and immune from further infection. 
  
The simulation is performed by changing the white background of our screen to other colors, each of which has its own meaning. Therefore, when the screen turns blue, the virus is being combated. The project also has three parameters: 1) the number of days when the virus is in active mode, 2) How many people died because of the virus and 3) How many people recovered from the virus and developed immunity.
